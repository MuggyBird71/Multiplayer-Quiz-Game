# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Dylan Phillips

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 2

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |       X       |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below:

Write a program that allows one computer to communicate with another computer using either of the following:

Client-Server Model—You will need to write one program for the client and one program for the server.

Peer-to-Peer Model—You will need to write one program for the peer to both send and receive.

The software must have the following characteristics:

The client or peer must send a request to the server or another peer. A response must be sent back and used (e.g. displayed).

You can use either TCP or UDP.

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Provide support for at least three different kinds of requests that the server or the peer can respond to.

Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for your program instead of the command line.

Modify the server or the peer to obtain information from a local file or database in response to a request from the client or another peer.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

- Oracle’s Java documentation on networking.
- Online tutorials like TutorialsPoint for practical guides.
- YouTube videos on Java networking.

2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

- Spend 2 hours reading about TCP/IP and UDP.
- Spend 3 hours following tutorials to create client-server and peer-to-peer applications.
- Spend 2 hours experimenting with different requests and responses.
- Use the last 3 hours to start building your demonstration software.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

A client-server application where the client can send different types of requests to the server, which processes and responds. Consider adding a simple GUI if possible.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

- Monday and Wednesday from 7 PM to 9 PM at home.
- Saturday from 9 AM to 1 PM at a local library or café.
- Sunday from 3 PM to 5 PM at home.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you anticipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitigation plan?

- Technical risk: Trouble managing multiple request types.
  - Mitigation: Start with a simple request and add more as you go.
- Behavioral risk: Procrastination or losing track of time.
  - Mitigation: Set mini-deadlines and use a timer to keep sessions productive.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum up these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|   5/13/24| 10:15 AM |   IM   | Planned                                    |     1:00    |
|   5/13/24|  7:00 PM |   IM   | Reading about TCP/IP and UDP               |     2:00    |
|   5/15/24|  7:00 PM |   IM   | Following tutorials on client-server and peer-to-peer |     3:00    |
|   5/18/24|  9:00 AM |   IM   | Experimenting with different requests and responses |     2:00    |
|   5/19/24|  3:00 PM |   IM   | Starting to build demonstration software   |     3:00    |
|   5/20/24|  7:00 PM |   IM   | Continuing to build demonstration software |     2:00    |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-game-server)

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:
   - [YouTube Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yourvideoid)

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |   Yes  |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|   Yes  |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |   Yes  |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |   Yes  |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |   Yes  |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

I implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) for the client program using `tkinter`.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

No.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|        13:00      |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

Strategies that worked well:
- Setting mini-deadlines helped keep the work on track.
- Using a timer ensured productive work sessions.

What did not work well:
- Initial trouble with managing multiple request types.

Ways to improve:
- Allocate more time for testing and debugging.
- Break down tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.
