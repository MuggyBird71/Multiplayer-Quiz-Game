## Overview

**Project Title**: Quiz Game Server

**Project Description**: 
This project is a Python-based multiplayer quiz game server that allows clients to connect and compete by answering dynamically generated quiz questions. The server generates questions using the OpenAI API and provides a scoring system to keep track of client scores. The project demonstrates the use of socket programming, threading, and API integration.

**Project Goals**: 
- To develop a Python application that handles network communication using socket programming.
- To provide a multiplayer quiz experience with dynamically generated questions.
- To demonstrate the integration of external APIs (OpenAI) for dynamic content generation.
